Apparently a 'no, thank you' to 'do you want some ketchup' means 17 (I counted) ackets of ketchup for 1 order of fries. Less a star because I'm not a fan of people being wasteful.

It's very clean, someone is always cleaning or just finished cleaning the rest rooms. No popcorn droppings in the lobby, on the counters or condiment station. Always friendly, smiling faces ready to clean the auditorium after the movie.

The auditoriums don't have stadium seating but there's  and incline and easy to see the screen, chairs are comfortable but not as large as the newer chairs. There's a LOT of leg room. This is where we go when we want to watch a movie and 'travel' back in time to visit a movie theater very similar to the one we went to growing up.",px0VdZdyTaclveb1LfV6rA,5,2016-07-09,0,0,Harkins Theatres Shea 14,Other

I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass.",e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,2,2016-07-02,1,1,Jasmine Tokyo,Other

Store is clean, but I gotta say...having clothes for sale...somehow... I no longer wanna call it 'fancy frys' it now seems more like...'wannabe walmart.' 

Almost down to a 3 thanks to that, BUT the pharmacy staff....AweSOME! Super courteous and helpful, really great empathy toward each customer. Not an easy task but they are shining stars in my book.",nUaLFTfUqVKMFQonsWBnag,4,2016-06-11,1,0,Fry's,Other
